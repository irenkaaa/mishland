    <h3>Pale Yellow</h3>
    <p>We've all heard about Gen-Z Yellow; now, meet its sophisticated older cousin. This buttery hue is a surefire way to make any space cozy without going deep. (Not to mention that it looks amazing with darker wood tones!) "It's a happy, sunny yellow, but it still has a little bit of a bite to it," says Katie Brown, who used the shade in her family's Connecticut home.</p>
